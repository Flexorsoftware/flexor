# FLEXOR
FLEXOR is a multiplatform software tool to simplify traditional complex and manual procedures for Musculo-articular stiffness analysis

The set-up of FLEXOR is a simple process:
1) Install D2XX drivers for FTDI devices: https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm
2) Reboot your computer
3) Install RXTX: http://rxtx.qbang.org/
4) Run Jar file via double click or through terminal (java -jar <pathToFlexor.jar>)
5) Connect your load-cell and start to work! (or use the sample data -FlexorSamples.zip- importing the different files)

Enjoy!
